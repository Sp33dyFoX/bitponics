 * Mocha Test
 *
 * Tests are organized by having a "describe" and "it" method. Describe
 * basically creates a "section" that you are testing and the "it" method
 * is what runs your test code.
 *
 * For asynchronous tests you need to have a done method that you call after
 * your code should be done executing so Mocha runs to test properly.
