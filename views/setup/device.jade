        | Now, we need to send your device key to your Base Station and tell it how to connect to your Wifi network. 
        | When in setup mode, the Base Station broadcasts a Wifi network named "BITPONICS". 
        | By connecting your computer to that network, you're able to send setup information to the device. 
      p We'll walk you through the process below. If at any time you need assistance, please contact us at our 
        a(href="/help") help page
