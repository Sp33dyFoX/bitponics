        | bitponics is your personal gardening assistant.
      p
        | It’s a device and a website that will simplify hydroponic gardening. You tell it about your setup and what plants you’re growing, and it provides you with a personalized growing plan that tells you how to achieve the best possible re- sults. Sensors in your garden send readings to your account on the Bitponics website. The website then processes that information and sends notifications back to your device to control things such as pumps and lights. You can track your results and share your experiences with other users, so that we all help each other become better gardeners.
