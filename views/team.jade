            | Amit Kumar has been a software engineer for 8 years and a plant lover for 20. After graduating from UCLA with a degree in Cognitive Science, he brought his knowledge of human information processing to the field of web software development, where he strives to produce products that aren’t just outstanding technically, but are also highly intuitive and a pleasure to use. He’s spent his career working with a variety of technologies in all aspects of software development. From the database to the back-end to the front-end, from .NET to PHP to node.js to HTML5/CSS3/Javascript, he crafts code to produce whatever the customer needs and more. He's delivered solutions for companies including Nike, Verizon, Barnes &amp; Noble and American Express.

            | Jack Bishop is a software engineer and web enthusiast with a passion for embracing change and building products for the future that he wants to see. For the better part of the last decade he has designed, developed, architected and maintained many popular websites, web applications and native mobile applications. His primary focus and interest has been mobile optimization on the web &mdash; even before it was cool, when mobile was treated as a second-class citizen. Clients include Nike, Johnson & Johnson, Tiffany & Co and AdCouncil. Recently he has become an amatuer gardener, running a small hydroponic garden with basil, tomato and pepper plants. He is currently counting down the days until his garden becomes self-aware, remotely controllable and logs data to the cloud.
